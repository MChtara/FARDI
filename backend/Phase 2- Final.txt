Phase 2 - Cultural Event Planning and Teamwork
Welcome, [Player]!
You're an essential member of the Cultural Event Planning Committee at your Tunisian university, ready to create a vibrant celebration of Tunisian culture! In Phase 1, you joined the orientation, received an email invitation, chose a cultural event theme, and brainstormed roles with Ms. Mabrouki (Event Coordinator), SKANDER (Student Council President), Emna, Ryan, and Lilia. Now, in Phase 2, you'll build the action plan through three steps-assigning roles, scheduling meetings, and planning tasks-culminating in a final action plan draft. Your AI Assistant, ChatGuide, will guide you with feedback to make your contributions shine. Let's make this event unforgettable!
How It Works:
* Engage in action items that feel like real event planning, such as sharing stories, suggesting roles, scheduling meetings, and drafting plans.
* Character avatars will provide feedback to keep you on track, encouraging you to move forward or practice more with fun, thematic tasks.
* Your goal is to develop the action plan while practicing your English in a lively, immersive way.
* Enjoy the journey and show your teamwork spirit

Phase 2 - Step 1: Assigning Roles
Learning Outcomes (For Implementers):
By the end of this step, students should demonstrate:
* A1 (Basic): Share simple stories about Phase 1, suggest and confirm roles with basic vocabulary, and reflect minimally on the event's cultural impact.
* A2 (Elementary): Tell short stories with basic connectors (e.g., "because"), make role suggestions with simple reasoning, and reflect with some cultural details.
* B1 (Intermediate): Narrate clear Phase 1 experiences, justify role suggestions with balanced reasoning, and reflect on roles with cultural connections.
* B2 (Upper-Intermediate): Craft engaging stories linking to Phase 1, provide detailed role justifications, and reflect fluently on the event's cultural significance.
Implementer Notes: Use these CEFR-aligned outcomes to calibrate feedback and scoring, but never display "A1," "A2," "B1," "B2," or scores to students. Present feedback as team encouragement (e.g., "Great start! Let's add more cultural details!") to maintain immersion in the cultural event planning context.

Scenario:
You're gathered in the vibrant committee room at the university, surrounded by colorful posters of past cultural events. Ms. Mabrouki, SKANDER, Emna, Ryan, and Lilia are buzzing with excitement about the event. Your action plan starts here: reflect on your Phase 1 journey, assign roles for tasks like decorations, music, food, and promotion, and ensure everyone's on board. Let's make this event a celebration of Tunisian culture!
Action Items:
1. Storytelling Introduction Task
Instructions: Ms. Mabrouki smiles and says, "Let's start by sharing how our orientation in Phase 1 inspired us for this event. What did you learn about our team or the event theme that excites you for planning?" Type or say a short story (2-3 sentences) about your experience from Phase 1 (e.g., orientation meeting, email invitation, choosing the event theme, role brainstorming). Make it lively to inspire the team!
Implementer Notes:
o Integration: Display Ms. Mabrouki's question in a speech bubble next to her animated avatar (e.g., a coordinator in Tunisian attire) in a committee room with cultural visuals (e.g., Tunisian tiles, event posters). Provide a text box for typing or a microphone icon for voice input (if Grok's voice mode is enabled). Include a "Hint" button suggesting "Mention the cultural theme or a teammate's idea from Phase 1."
o Answers: Expect:
* A1: "I like orientation. Theme is culture."
* A2: "In Phase 1, I learn about team. Theme is fun."
* B1: "In Phase 1, we chose a cultural theme, and I liked Emna's idea for music."
* B2: "During Phase 1's orientation, we selected a vibrant Tunisian cultural theme, and SKANDER's leadership inspired me to plan this event."
o Feedback: Use NLP to analyze vocabulary (e.g., "culture" vs. "vibrant"), grammar (e.g., simple past vs. complex structures), and relevance to Phase 1. Deliver feedback via Ms. Mabrouki's avatar, e.g., "Great story, [Player]! Try 'we chose a theme' to make it clearer for our team." Never mention CEFR levels or terms like "grammar."
o Scoring: A1 = 1, A2 = 2, B1 = 3, B2 = 4. B2 contributes to progression. Hide levels/scores from students.

o Feedback: Use NLP to analyze vocabulary (e.g., "art" vs. "creativity"), grammar (e.g., simple present "do" vs. complex "is ideal"), and relevance (e.g., skill-based reasoning). Deliver feedback via Ms. Mabrouki's avatar, e.g., "Nice idea, [Player]! Try 'Emna should do decorations' to sound more confident in our action plan." Never mention CEFR levels or technical terms.
o Scoring: A1 = 1, A2 = 2, B1 = 3, B2 = 4. B2 contributes to progression. Hide levels/scores.
3. Peer Negotiation Task

Implementer Notes:
o Integration: Display SKANDER's dialogue in a speech bubble with his avatar (e.g., a student leader with a notebook). Provide a text box or voice input. Include a "Hint" button suggesting "Try agreeing or explaining your choice politely."

Success Feedback (Displayed for B2-Level Performance Across All Action Items):
Ms. Mabrouki's avatar claps enthusiastically: "Wow, [Player]! Your action plan for assigning roles is brilliant and full of energy! You've captured the spirit of our cultural event perfectly. Ready to schedule our first meeting? Let's move to [Step 2: Scheduling Meetings]!"
Remedial Feedback (Displayed for A1-B1 Performance):
Ms. Mabrouki's avatar smiles warmly: "Great start, [Player]! You're bringing our cultural event to life, but let's add a bit more sparkle to your skills. Join us for some fun action items to prepare for the next step in our action plan!"
Remedial Action Items (for A1-B1 Students):
Avoid referring to these activities as 'remedial'; their purpose is to support participants through a smooth and structured transition toward targeted practice opportunities whenever they experience difficulties or setbacks, ultimately helping them enhance their performance.
Students scoring less than 20 points (B2 across all five action items) engage in remedial action items (A, B, C, D). Progression to the next remedial action item or Step 2 depends on performance, with feedback delivered by character avatars to maintain the cultural event theme. Use CEFR levels (A1, A2, B1) internally to assign tasks but never show them to students.
